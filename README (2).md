my udacity project

SYNOPSIS

I created a multi user blog that requires sophisticated authenication registration and login. My blog enables each user to post thier own blogs, comment on other post and even like the post(just not their own). If they regret something they said or commented, the have the power to edit or remove it entirely. The project thought me how to put together a multi user website that everyone could be able to use. i found this project to be very difficult and ran into many difficulties. When i got stuck,i tried to look at anyone elses code and compare apart of my project to thiers to see where i may have messed up. I used https://github.com/mc4rol9/multi-user-blog code as a comparison when i ran into trouble. If anything seems similar, I will give him credit for his inspiration on how to do it the right way. As soon as the project passes, i will deploy it.
